Swift took language ideas

> ["from Objective-C, Rust, Haskell, Ruby, Python, C#, CLU, and far too many others to list."](http://nondot.org/sabre/)

(Swift language creator Chris Lattner)

Note:
And Mr. Chris Lattner is no longer with Apple. Or Tesla. Now he's making artificial brains at Google.

Features include:

strong typing, implicit typing, mutable and immutable variables, OO, functional language features, generics, cross-platform support, and more.
