# Clear Function Presentations

We occasionally will speak at conferences, user groups, or meetups about technology. We also often have lunch and learns where we share knowledge with each other. This is a common (and open!) place where our slides are stored.

At the moment, most of these are built using [Reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js).
